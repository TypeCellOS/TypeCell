# Notebooks and Cells

The page you're looking at is called a *notebook*.
It's basically an interactive document that mixes _code_ and _text_ (documentation).

## Creating and reordering cells

When you hover over a cell, click the `+` sign to insert a new cell above or below.

To reorder a cell, hover next to it (try it out on the left of this text), and simply drag and drop the cell.

To view the source code of a cell, hover over the cell and click the caret <svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="notebookCell-sideIcon" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Show / hide code</title><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M10.072 8.024L5.715 3.667l.618-.62L11 7.716v.618L6.333 13l-.618-.619 4.357-4.357z"></path></svg> on the top left. 
You'll notice the text you're reading now is writting in Markdown.

## Cell types
TypeCell currently supports a number of languages. You can view / change the language of a cell in the bottom-left of the cell editor.

### Markdown
Useful for writing text / documentation. Markdown cells are collapsed by default (code cells are expanded by default).

### CSS
Use CSS to easily style the output of other cells (those written in Markdown or TypeScript).


```css
.redText {
  color: red;
}

```

<div class="redText">This text is red, styled by the CSS cell above.</div>



### TypeScript / JavaScript

```typescript
export let message = "This is a TypeScript cell";

```

TypeScript cells execute automatically as you type.Try editing the`message` above.
