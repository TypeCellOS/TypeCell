# Reactive variables

This is where things get interesting! Your code can reference variables exported by other cells.

Cells in TypeCell Notebooks (re)evaluate when:

*   The code of the cell changes (i.e.: you're editing the code)
*   A variable the cell depends upon updates

## The `$` variable

Exports of cells are available under the `$` variable. Have a look at the example below, and change the `name` variable to your own name. Notice how the greeting in the cell below updates automatically.


```typescript
export let name = "Anonymous coder";

```

```typescript
export let greeting = (
  <div>
    Hello, <strong>{$.name}</strong>!
  </div>
);

```

<small>Tip: type `$.` in a TypeScript cell, and the editor (Intellisense) will display a list of all exported variables you can reference.</small>

## Interactive Tutorial

The Reactive model of TypeCell is quite powerful. If you haven't already, follow the [interactive tutorial]() or have a look at the [examples]() to get some hands-on experience.
