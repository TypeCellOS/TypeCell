## Running locally

Node.js is required to run this project. To download Node.js, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To run the project, open the command line in the project's root directory and enter the following commands:

    # Install all required npm modules
    npm install

    # Initial build of all packages required by the main editor project
    npm run build

    # Start supabase
    npm run start:supabase
    # to stop docker containers later, run: npm run stop:supabase

    # Start the local server
    npm run start:server

    # Start the main editor project
    npm start

The above `npm start` executes the `vite dev` command of `packages/editor` and watches for changes to this main package.

<!-- ## Watch changes

    npm run watch

You might also be making changes to other packages in the `packages` directory. To continuously watch and compile for changes, open a new terminal and run `npm run watch`. -->

## Testing

The codebase is automatically tested using Vitest and Playwright. When submitting a PR or issue, ideally try to add a test case for it.
