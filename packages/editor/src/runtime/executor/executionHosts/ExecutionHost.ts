 * - Local
 * - Sandboxed

 * The LocalExecutionHost just renders output in the same document as the container, and can be used for testing
 * The SandboxExecutionHost renders an iframe and evaluates end-user code in there, to isolate the code execution in a different domain.
 *
 * ExecutionHosts are called from NotebookRenderer (which renders the monaco editors for cells)
