# Welcome to TypeCell

Hi there üëã ! Welcome to the community preview of TypeCell, an open source platform for _live_, _interactive_ documents.

A TypeCell document (like the one you're looking at!) is similar to a document in _Notion_ or _Google Docs_. Go ahead and try editing this page.

However, TypeCell comes with a _Live Programming Environment_, that makes it possible to create your own blocks and build rich, interactive documents:

```typescript
export default (
  <div>
    <em>Hello from React!</em>
  </div>
);
```

This guide should help you to get started, and learn more about the ins & outs.
