# Imports & NPM

TypeCell supports importing code from NPM, or from other TypeCell documents.

## Importing other notebooks

You can split your code into multiple documents.

This is a great way to create reusable components that you can use across documents, or even share with the community.

`import * as myNotebook from "!@username/notebook";`

See this example, where we import a message from an external notebook [`@yousef/demo-message`](https://www.typecell.org/@yousef/demo-message).

```typescript
import * as myNotebook from "!@yousef/demo-message";

export default myNotebook.message;
```

**ðŸš€ TypeCell documents are designed to be as "live" as possible**: when you change the code of your imported document,
the document that imports the code will update live, as-you-type.

## NPM

In TypeCell, you can also use any library from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). Simply import the library in a code block, and we'll try to resolve it (including TypeScript types) automatically.

### Example

Let's use the [canvas-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti) library to make it rain confetti!

```typescript
import { create } from "canvas-confetti";

export const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
canvas.width = 200;
canvas.height = 100;

const myConfetti = create(canvas);

// Drop some confetty every 500ms
setInterval(() => myConfetti({ particleCount: 70, origin: { y: 0 } }), 500);
```

### Compatibility

Libraries are loaded in your browser via [ESM.sh](https://www.esm.sh/).
ESM.sh support is best for modern libraries with ESM support, but not all NPM libraries are compatible.

Can't get a library to work? Let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TcJ9TRC3SV)!

#### TypeScript

When available, TypeCell tries to automatically resolve types for your library.
Some libraries don't ship with TypeScript types. In this case, an error might appear, but the library can still work.
