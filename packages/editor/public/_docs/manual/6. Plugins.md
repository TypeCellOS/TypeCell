# Plugins

A powerful concept that TypeCell explores is _End User Programming_. In TypeCell, it's possible to customize the program you're using (a Notion-style document editor) with new capabilities, _right from within the application itself_. This means you can modify the way TypeCell works, without changing the source code, but just by creating new code in TypeCell code blocks.

## Map block

When using software like Notion, Google Docs, or Word, you're limited to the blocks they provide (paragraphs, images, lists, tables, etc.). What if you want to add an interactive map, or chart to your document? Let's explore how this can be done in TypeCell.

Let's first set up the code to render a Map, based on _react-map-gl_.

### Map code

First, let's set up some reactive variables for our map component:

```typescript
export let zoom = 1;
export let latitude = 1;
export let longitude = 1;
export let markers: Array<{
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  color: string;
  text: string;
}> = [];
```

And import the required CSS stylesheet:

```typescript
import css from "maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl.css";
export { css };
```

Now, let's create the main code that renders our map component:

```typescript
import MapLibre, { Marker, Source, Layer, Popup } from "react-map-gl/maplibre";
import maplibregl from "maplibre-gl";

export const map = (
  <div style={{ width: 700, height: 400 }}>
    <MapLibre
      onMove={(e) => {
        $.zoom = e.viewState.zoom;
        $.latitude = e.viewState.latitude;
        $.longitude = e.viewState.longitude;
      }}
      longitude={$.longitude}
      latitude={$.latitude}
      zoom={$.zoom}
      mapStyle="https://demotiles.maplibre.org/style.json">
      {$.markers.map((m, i) => (
        <Marker
          key={i}
          latitude={m.latitude}
          longitude={m.longitude}
          color={m.color}
          popup={m.text ? new maplibregl.Popup().setText(m.text) : undefined}
        />
      ))}
    </MapLibre>
  </div>
);
```

### Register a plugin

Now, we can register the _Map_ variable as a Block that can be added to any document. Try it out by typing "/" in this document, or clicking the + icon next to a block. You'll see that you can now add Map blocks to the document.

```typescript
// Plugin registration
typecell.editor.registerBlock({
  name: "Map",
  blockVariable: "map",
  // Variables for properties screen that's auto-generated
  // and shows when clicking the settings-gear icon
  settings: {
    latitude: true,
    longitude: true,
    zoom: true,
  },
});
```

Your local environment will keep track of registered plugins. Now that you've visited this page, you can reuse the Plugin registered here in any other document you create. Try this out by signing in, and going to a document in your own workspace. Access the document / plugin menu via the top-right dots.
