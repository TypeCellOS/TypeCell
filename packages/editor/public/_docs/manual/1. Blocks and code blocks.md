# Blocks and code blocks

The page you're looking at is an interactive document that mixes _code_ and _text_. A document consists of different blocks, highlighted when you hover over them. TypeCell supports all kind of blocks, like _headings_, _paragraphs_, _lists_, or more advanced _code blocks_.

## Creating and reordering Blocks

When you hover over a block, click the `+` sign to insert a new block. You can also type "/" anywhere to open the slash-menu that allows you to add a new block.

To reorder a block, hover next to it (try it out on the left of this text), and simply drag and drop the block via the drag handle (⋮⋮).

## Code blocks

TypeCell Code Blocks currently supports Typescript and CSS. You can view / change the language of a code block in the bottom-right of the code block editor.

### CSS

Use CSS to easily style the output of other code blocks (those written in Markdown or TypeScript).

```css
.redText {
  color: red;
}
```

```typescript
export default (
  <div className="redText">
    This text is red, styled by the CSS code block above.
  </div>
);
```

### TypeScript / JavaScript

```typescript
export let message = "This is a TypeScript code block";
```

TypeScript code blocks execute automatically as you type. Try editing the `message` above.
