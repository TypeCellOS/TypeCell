# Reactive variables

This is where things get interesting! Your code can reference variables exported by other blocks.

Code blocks in TypeCell (re)evaluate when:

- The code of the cell changes (i.e.: you're editing the code)
- A variable the block depends upon updates

## The `$` variable

Exports of cells are available under the "$" variable. Have a look at the example below, and change the "name" variable to your own name. Notice how the greeting in the cell below updates automatically.

```typescript
export let name = "Anonymous coder";
```

```typescript
export let greeting = (
  <div>
    Hello, <strong>{$.name}</strong>!
  </div>
);
```

_Tip: type "$." in a TypeScript cell, and the editor (Intellisense) will display a list of all exported variables you can reference._

## Interactive Tutorial

The Reactive model of TypeCell is quite powerful. If you haven't already, follow the [live coding tutorial](/docs/Live%20coding%20tutorial.md) to get some hands-on experience.
