# Aligned software

> If software is eating the world, maybe let's step back and see what we want that software to look like?

Humans are toolmakers, and software is one of the most powerful tools we've ever created. But what if we fail to understand how our tools work? What if we can't tinker with our tools anymore? Or worse, what if the tools we use are designed in ways thay don't align with our values and needs as users?

We would end up disempowered, trapped in a world where our tools are calling the shots. This would lead to a lack of agency, limiting our ability to shape our lives and society in line with our shared values and aspirations.

Unfortunately, this is already happening. While we increasingly depend on digital technology, only a select few are privileged to understand how it works. This digital divide widens as software becomes more and more complex and less transparent. Meanwhile, the creators our software often have different incentives than us, leading to privacy, security and ethical issues abound.

It doesn't have to be this way. We can design our tools differently. The **Aligned Software Manifesto** explores what this can look like.
