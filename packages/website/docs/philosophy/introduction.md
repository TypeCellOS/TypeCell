# Aligned software

> If software is eating the world, maybe let's step back and see what we want that software to look like?

We believe humans are toolmakers. Software is one of the most powerful tools we have. But what if we fail to understand how our tools work? What if we can't tinker with our tools anymore? Or worse, what if the tools we use are designed in such a way that they are not aligned with our values and needs as users?

We would end up disempowered, trapped in a world where our tools are calling the shots. This would lead to a lack of agency, limiting our ability to shape our lives and society according to our shared values and aspirations.

Unfortunately, this is already happening.
