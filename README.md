# Features

- Open Source, cell-based notebook environment
- Same, powerful editing experience as VS Code
- Full TypeScript support! (no weird custom language constructs)
- Reactive Runtime, cells automatically re-evaluate when their dependencies update ([learn more](https://www.typecell.org/docs/manual/3.%20Reactive%20variables.md))
- Import NPM packages + types just by writing an `import` statement
- Support for real-time collaboration (using [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs))
- Runs on top of [Matrix](https://www.matrix.org) using [Matrix-CRDT](https://github.com/yousefed/matrix-crdt).

# Feedback üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We'd love to hear your thoughts and see your experiments, so [come and say hi on Discord](https://discord.gg/TcJ9TRC3SV) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#typecell-space:matrix.org).

# Contributing üôå

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info and guidance on how to run the project (TLDR: just use `npm start`).

TypeCell is organised as a monorepo containing several packages. Directory structure:

```
typecell
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common          - Utility functions shared across the codebase
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ editor          - The main React application
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engine          - The live-code execution engine
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packager        - Tool to bundle TypeCell notebook apps (WIP)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ parsers         - Helpers to convert to / from TypeCell notebooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patches             - patch-package patches
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-util           - Server and data for unit tests
```

The codebase is automatically tested using Vitest and Playwright.

# Credits ‚ù§Ô∏è

We build on top of some really great technologies:

- [Monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor): the open source editor that also powers VS Code
- [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs): CRDT for multi-user collaboration
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/): for our Reactive Runtime
- [Matrix](https://www.matrix.org): the backend of TypeCell.org is a single Matrix instance, using [Matrix-CRDT](https://github.com/yousefed/matrix-crdt) to store and collaborate on "documents as chat rooms"
- [ESM.sh](https://www.esm.sh/): for dynamic ESM imports from NPM
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): for our compiler and language toolkit
