Welcome to TypeCell, where Notion meets Jupyter Notebooks - all open source. TypeCell is a fresh take on what documents and software can look like. Together, we want to make it a lot easier to build software, and ultimately to understand, build and share knowledge.

# Features

- Open Source Notion-style workspaces and documents (powered by [BlockNote](https://www.blocknotejs.org))
- [Local-First](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) architecture built using [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs), with support for live multi-user collaboration
- Code Blocks for a live, as-you-type coding experience enabling [End-User Programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/)
- Same, powerful editing experience as VS Code
- Full TypeScript and React support! (no weird custom language constructs)
- The Reactive Runtime makes sure code blocks automatically re-evaluate when their dependencies update ([learn more](https://www.typecell.org/docs/manual/3.%20Reactive%20variables.md))
- Import NPM packages + types just by writing a regular `import` statement

TypeCell is organised as a monorepo containing several packages. Directory structure:

```
typecell
├── packages
│   ├── editor        - The main React application
│   ├── engine        - The live-code execution engine and Reactive Runtime
│   ├── frame         - sandboxed iframe where end-user code evaluates
│   ├── packager      - Tool to bundle TypeCell notebook apps (WIP)
│   ├── parsers       - Helpers to convert to / from TypeCell documents
│   ├── server        - HocusPocus + Supabase server for storing documents
│   ├── shared        - TypeCell specific models shared across the codebase
│   ├── shared-test   - Helper functions shared across the codebase for unit tests
│   └── util          - Generic helper functions
├── patches           - patch-package patches
└── test-util         - Data for unit tests
```

The codebase is automatically tested using Vitest and Playwright.
